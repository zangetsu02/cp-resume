# Resume

Inspired by [Anthony Fu](https://github.com/antfu)

## How it works

- The data is hosted by [Gist](https://gist.github.com/antfu/ceb04ede6daf195eaf51e32b6aef5d4e) with [JSON Resume](https://jsonresume.org/) standard.
- The website is hosted by [Netlify](http://netlify.com/) with CI/CD.
- HTML is generated with [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) and PDF is printed with [puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/).
